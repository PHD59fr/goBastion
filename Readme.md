## ✨ **Key Concept – Database as the Source of Truth**

In **goBastion**, **the database is the single source of truth** for SSH keys and access management. This means that the system always reflects the state of the database. Any key or access added manually to the system without passing through the bastion will be **automatically removed** to maintain consistency.

### How it works:
- **Key Addition**:  
  When a user adds an SSH key, it is first validated and stored in the database. The bastion then automatically synchronizes the database with the system, adding the key to the appropriate location.

- **Automatic Synchronization**:  
  The bastion periodically checks the system for any discrepancies. If it finds an SSH key that is not in the database, the key is immediately removed from the system to ensure security and consistency.

### **Advantages of this Approach**
- **Centralized Control**: All modifications go through the bastion, ensuring tight access management.
- **Enhanced Security**: Unauthorized keys cannot remain on the system.
- **State Consistency**: The system always mirrors the database state.
- **Audit and Traceability**: Every change is recorded in the database.
- **Fully Automated Management**: No need for manual checks; synchronization handles everything.
- **Easy Exportability**: The system can be deployed on a new container effortlessly. Since the database is the source of truth, replicating it with synchronization scripts provides a functional bastion on a new instance.

## 📥 **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/phd59fr/goBastion.git
   cd goBastion
   ```

2. Build the Docker container:
   ```sh
   docker build -t gobastion .
   ```

3. Run the Docker container:
   ```sh
   docker run --name gobastion --hostname goBastion -d -p 2222:22 gobastion:latest
   ```
   You can also use the official **Docker Hub** image:
   ```sh
   docker run --name gobastion --hostname goBastion -d -p 2222:22 phd59fr/gobastion:latest
   ```
   (optional) 3a. Launch the container with a volume to persist the database and ttyrec:
   ```sh
   docker run --name gobastion --hostname goBastion -d -p 2222:22 -v /path/to/your/dbvolume:/var/lib/goBastion -v /path/to/your/ttyvolume:/app/ttyrec gobastion:latest
   ```

4. Create the first user:
   ```sh
   docker exec -it gobastion /app/goBastion --firstInstall
   ```
   (optional) 4a. Restore your bastion from a database (requires 3a):
   ```sh
   docker exec -it gobastion /app/goBastion --restore
   ```

5. Connect to the bastion host (interactive mode):
   ```sh
   ssh -tp 2222 user@localhost
   ```
   (optional) 5a. Connect to the bastion host with a command (non-interactive mode):
   ```sh
   ssh -tp 2222 user@localhost -- -osh selfListIngressKeys
   ```
   (optional) 5b. Connect to the target host through the bastion:
   ```sh
   ssh -tp 2222 user@localhost -- user@targethost (ssh options supported)
   ```
